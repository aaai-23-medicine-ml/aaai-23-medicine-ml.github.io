<b> Some Thoughts on The Deployment of Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Medicine </b> <br>

Abstract: <br>
In the past several years, while a lot of exciting research has been done in the field of Artificial
intelligence (AI) in medicine, however, very few have been deployed in routine clinical practice. In this
presentation, a few major challenges and potential solutions for the clinical deployment of AI will be
discussed. One of those is model generalizability issue. For many clinical applications, it is impossible to
develop a universal model that works anytime anywhere for anybody. Some AI models may need to be
commissioned and individualized at institution, clinician, and even patient level. Another challenge
comes from the noisy data annotations due to the inconsistencies between different observers. In many
cases, we may need to respect (some) noisy data annotations. This is because, medicine is still an art
and there is often no one single best solution. We have to face this reality when developing and
deploying AI in clinical medicine. Some other challenges including model performance deterioration as
well as AI/clinician integration will be discussed as well.

A Short Bio of Dr. Steve Jiang: <br>
Dr. Steve Jiang received his Ph.D. in Medical Physics from Medical College of Ohio in 1998. After completing
his postdoctoral training at Stanford University, he joined Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard
Medical School in 2000 as an Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology. In 2007, Dr. Jiang was recruited to
University of California San Diego as a tenured Associate Professor to build Center for Advanced
Radiotherapy Technologies, for which he was the founding and executive director. He was then promoted to
Full Professor with tenure in 2011. In October 2013, Dr. Jiang joined University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center as a tenured Full Professor, Barbara Crittenden Professor in Cancer Research, Vice Chair for Digital
Health and AI of Radiation Oncology Department, and Director of Medical Physics and Engineering Division.
Dr. Jiang is a Fellow of Institute of Physics, American Association of Physicists in Medicine, and American
Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering. Dr. Jiang&#39;s research in various areas of cancer radiotherapy
has been funded by federal, state, charitable, and industrial grants for over 20 million dollars, resulting in over
200 peer-reviewed journal papers with an H-index of 84. His current research interest is on the development
and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies to solve medical problems. He is the founding director of
Medical Artificial Intelligence and Automation Laboratory at UT Southwestern. He has supervised over 30
postdoctoral fellows and 10 Ph.D. students.

<b> Advanced and Accessible Health Data Science with Rtemis </b> <br> 

Efstathios D. Gennatas, MBBS AICSM PhD <br>
University of California, San Francisco <br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
Health-related data generated from basic research, electronic health records, and
wearables, among others, is continuously proliferating. At the same time, the questions
such data is used to answer are increasing in number and complexity. To address
these, Health Data Science depends on effective collaboration across fields and
disciplines. It requires: </br>

1. Domain expertise in biomedical science/clinical medicine, </br>
2. Quantitative expertise in Statistics/Machine Learning,
and </br>
3. Technical expertise in computer programming, data management, and more.
</br>
Domain-aware health data science software built to combine domain, quantitative, and
technical expertise can help catalyze interdisciplinary work and the development of
effective and efficient analysis pipelines.
</br>
Rtemis is a comprehensive health data science platform designed around that principle.
It provides:
</br>
1. Visualization, including static and interactive graphics </br>
2. Advanced procedures for statistics and machine learning, including supervised and
unsupervised learning </br>

The rtemis ecosystem is novel in providing both: <br>
1. 'rtemis': A highly flexible and efficient API that allows programming access to
advanced visualization and modeling <br>
2. 'rtemislive': A web application providing a no-code, graphical user interface to 'rtemis' <br>

The API and web application are accompanied by extensive documentation and can be
used by data science experts and novice users alike. The modular and efficient design
of rtemis makes it also well-suited for the development of novel ML algorithms.
Algorithms developed in rtemis include the Additive Tree, the Linear Additive Tree, and
Expert-Augmented Machine Learning.</br>

Ongoing work includes expanding domain-specific functionality (e.g. in bioinformatics,
medical imaging, epidemiology, etc.) as well as
creating educational modules for health data science training.

<br>
A Short Bio: <br>
Efstathios D. Gennatas, MBBS AICSM PhD, is an Assistant Professor in the
Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, an affiliate at the Bakar Computational
Health Science Institute, and a member of the Center for Intelligent Imaging at the
University of California, San Francisco. He completed medical school at Imperial
College London and doctoral training in Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania.
His work includes applied data science in basic and clinical research as well as
development of methods and software for biomedical data analysis, while he also
teaches programming for health data science.

<b>Targeted Learning: The bridge from machine learning to statistical and causal inference
 </b> </br> 

Mark Van der Laan </br>
Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley </br>
</br>
Abstract: </br>
Society is drowning in data and the dominant practice of learning from data is to apply traditional statistical methods that are too simplistic, arbitrarily chosen, and subject to manipulation. Nonetheless, these methods inform policy and science, affecting our sense of reality and judgements. This talk exposes this deceptive practice, and presents a solution â€” a principled and reproducible approach, termed targeted learning, for generating actionable and truthful information from complex, real-world data. This approach unifies causal inference, machine learning and deep statistical theory to answer causal questions with statistical confidence.
</br>
Targeted learning provides an optimal statistical methodology for assessing causal impacts in a diversity of settings. Due to these desirable properties, interest in targeted learning has rapidly accelerated since its inception in 2006; top universities have incorporated targeted learning into the curriculum, the US FDA real world evidence group established working groups for targeted learning, funded demonstration projects on Targeted Learning, and a suite of software packages for targeted learning have been built to facilitate implementation. Targeted learning has been applied to the following real-world scenarios: complex longitudinal observational studies involving multiple time-point interventions and time-dependent confounding, survival analysis, networks of connected units, optimal individualized treatment rules, online learning for time series, multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning, and data-adaptive experimental design. We will demonstrate the optimality of targeted learning in these settings, and discuss its utility in other areas, such as AI, where there is growing interest in enhancing machine intelligence with statistical and causal inference.

Bio: </br>
Mark Johannes van der Laan is the Jiann-Ping Hsu/Karl E. Peace Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley.  His research interests include statistical methods in genomics (i.e., computational biology), survival analysis, censored data, targeted maximum likelihood estimation in semiparametric models, causal inference, data adaptive loss-based super learning, and multiple testing. He has made important contributions in both theoretical and applied machine learning in particular and statistics in general. He is known for being one of the co-developers of the super learner theory, targeted learning as well as the highly adaptative lasso.

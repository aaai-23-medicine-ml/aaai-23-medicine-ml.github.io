<h2>About the bridge program</h2>
<p>
The increased availability of data offers the potential to transform healthcare, using advances in machine learning (ML). However, the application of ML to medicine is fraught with pitfalls. Medical datasets often have errors and confounders. Predictive algorithms can fail to recognize data problems and then can make mistakes - often where human experts would not. Many algorithms fail to account for the context in which data is generated and then make poor recommendations. Additionally, these algorithms can be data inefficient, often requiring hundreds of thousands of examples to train. These issues are barriers to the deployment of ML models in clinical settings. The goal of this bridge program is to enable communication between ML practitioners and clinicians who can deploy ML models to assist medical decisions.</p>
